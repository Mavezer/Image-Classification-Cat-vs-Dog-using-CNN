# Image-Classification-Cat-vs-Dog-using-CNN
Neural network and training using dataset available online on Kaggle (Cats Vs Dogs). I have used tensorflow keras and ImageDataGenerator to build this neural network. All data labeling is done with help of ImageDataGenerator . convolutional neural network with max pooling and dense layers is used for building up the model.
